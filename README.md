## Project and developer details

Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. has aimed to digitize their products and chose LockedMe.com as the project to start with. I am asked to create a prototype of the application with the following features:
1.	Retrieving the file names in an ascending order
2.	Business-level operations:
  a.	Option to add a user specified file to the application
  b.	Option to delete a user specified file from the application
  c.	Option to search a user specified file from the application
  d.	Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context
3.	Option to close the application. 

Developer name: Amit Kumar Shah

 ## Java concepts used in the project

### Switch Statements
The Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions. It is like if-else-if ladder statement. The switch statement works with byte, short, int, long, enum types, String and some wrapper types like Byte, Short, Int, and Long. In other words, the switch statement tests the equality of a variable against multiple values.

### While loop
The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true. As soon as the Boolean condition becomes false, the loop automatically stops. The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.



### Try and catch statements
Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used within the method. If an exception occurs at the particular statement in the try block, the rest of the block code will not execute. So, it is recommended not to keep the code in try block that will not throw an exception. Java try block must be followed by either catch or finally block.

### Class
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical. An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

### File class
The File class is an abstract representation of file and directory pathname. A pathname can be either absolute or relative. The File class have several methods for working with directories and files such as creating new directories or files, deleting and renaming directories or files, listing the contents of a directory etc.

### Array
Array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, the elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

### Bubble sorting
In bubble sort algorithm, array is traversed from first element to last element. Here, current element is compared with the next element. If current element is greater than the next element, it is swapped.

 
### Conclusion 

The product created can add, delete, search and show the files a user wants from a specific folder. The product can be refined by providing the feature of adding, deleting and searching multiple files in one go. The current application prompts user before every command. Another feature that can make the product more robust can be the addition of password verification before deleting or adding any file. This password can be verified once the user start using the application.
